This reaction suggests that the first man perceives the third man's actions as threatening. The third man continues to run after the first man, indicating a pursuit. The second man, who was initially in a hurry, also turns around and starts running in the same direction as the first man, further escalating the sense of urgency and danger in the scene.\n\nThe video captures a tense and potentially dangerous situation where individuals are running and reacting to an unseen threat or emergency.
