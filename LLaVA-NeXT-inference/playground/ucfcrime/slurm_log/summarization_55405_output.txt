In a cluttered environment, a dark-skinned man in a gray hoodie and black hat is writing on a white paper on a black table. A man in a black coat and khaki hat engages in conversation with him, occasionally gesturing while the hooded man writes. A man in a black suit enters the scene, interacts with them, and stands by a red counter. Meanwhile, a woman in a red hoodie, black pants, and white shoes attends to tasks at a burgundy counter, and other suited staff members are seen working or moving around the area."}
